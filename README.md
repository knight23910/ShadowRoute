ShadowRoute is an open-source network privacy protection framework that combines:

✅ VPN tunneling (WireGuard/OpenVPN)  
✅ Automatic proxy & port rotation  
✅ Tor identity renewal on every cycle  
✅ Dead proxy health detection & removal  

Built for:
- Privacy protection
- Security research
- Network testing
- Learning real-world networking systems

## 🔐 How ShadowRoute Works

Your System  
↓  
VPN Tunnel  
↓  
Rotating Proxy / Tor Network  
↓  
Internet  

✔ Your ISP sees only VPN  
✔ Websites see only rotated IP  
✔ Real IP never exposed

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Auto IP & Port Rotation (configurable time)
- 🧅 Tor NEW identity every cycle
- 🌐 VPN + Proxy hybrid mode
- 🩺 Proxy health checker (auto removes dead proxies)
- ⚙️ YAML based configuration
- 📦 Clean modular architecture
